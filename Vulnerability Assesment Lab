# üß† Windows 11 Vulnerability Assessment Lab  
### with Nessus

**Purpose:** This repository contains step-by-step documentation and artifacts for a SOC Analyst Lab performing a vulnerability assessment of a Windows 11 VM using Nessus.

Okey, so this lab will consist in the following parts, I will try to explain what I did in each of them and the knowdledge that it gives you.
‚û°Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏è
  1. Initial Windows VM Setup
  2. How to Install Nessus
  3. How to Configure Nessus for Scanning
  4. Nessus Initial Scan
  5. Configuration of Credentials for Credential Scan
  6. Nessus Credential Scan
  7. Installation of Vulnerable Software
  8. Advanced Nessus Scanning for Vulnerable Software
  9. Remediation of Vulnerabilities

First, I started downloading the windows 11 image from the official website and cheking the MD5 hash for integrity. Then I installed the Image in Virtual Box and configured so we can get started.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ INITIAL WINDOWS VM SETUP

Now, before I begin scanning it with NAOS, I need to make it a bit more vulnerable. This includes turning off security updates, uninstalling any existing updates and turning off the firewall. These steps are crucial to ensure that nses can accurately identify any vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the system so we can address them and improve the VM security later.
