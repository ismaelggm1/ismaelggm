<h1>Hi, I'm Ismael! <br/><a href="(https://github.com/ismaelggm1/ismaelggm)">Data Analyst</a>,   Future Cybersecurity SOC Analyst</h1>

## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me
I‚Äôm a cybersecurity enthusiast with hands-on experience in threat hunting, SOC analysis, and incident response. I‚Äôve completed practical labs on TryHackMe and other platforms, giving me real-world exposure to tools and techniques used in security operations.

I hold certifications such as Google Cybersecurity Professional and SOC Analyst L1, and I‚Äôm currently preparing to take the CompTIA Security+ exam. My goal is to grow as a SOC Analyst, applying my skills to detect, analyze, and respond to threats effectively.

I‚Äôm passionate about continuous learning, hands-on labs, and sharing knowledge with the community.

<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª My Blue Team Projects </h2>

## üß© Project 1: Hunt Me I ‚Äî Payment Collectors (TryHackMe SOC Investigation)

‚û°Ô∏è Read it here [Hunt Me I: Payment Collectors](https://medium.com/@ismaelggm/hunt-me-i-payment-collectors-walkthrough-2e2a06650ce6) 
  
**Description:** Detailed SOC analyst walkthrough of the "Payment Collectors" scenario. This repo documents each step of the investigation from email and host triage to threat hunting with Elastic Stack, showcasing artifacts, screenshots, KQL queries, IOCs, and detection recommendations.

**What I delivered:**
- Step-by-step SOC investigation notes and screenshots from Kali/Elastic/Windows VMs
  
- Comprehensive list of IOCs (IPs, domains, file hashes) discovered during the exercise
- 
- KQL queries used to hunt for suspicious PowerShell, process creation, and network behavior in Elastic
  
- Detection guidance and remediation suggestions for SOC engineers

**Key highlights:**
- Recreated attacker TTPs and mapped them to MITRE ATT&CK techniques
  
- Example KQL+Dashboards to accelerate analyst response
  
- Evidence-backed remediation playbook for containment and eradication

**Tools & Tech:** TryHackMe, Elastic Stack (Kibana), Windows forensic artifacts, Kali Linux, CyberChef, YARA

## üß† Project 2: PhishStrike Lab ‚Äî Threat Intel and Email Analysis

‚û°Ô∏è Read it here [PhishStrike Lab](https://medium.com/@ismaelggm/phishstrike-lab-7a6ae090474c)  

**Description:** This project focuses on analyzing phishing email headers and leveraging threat intelligence tools to identify Indicators of Compromise (IOCs). The investigation uncovered malware distribution, persistence mechanisms, and command-and-control (C2) communications involving CoinMiner, BitRAT, and AsyncRAT.

**Key highlights:**
- Extracted sender IP (SPF softfail, DKIM fail)
- Identified malicious URLs and payloads
- Analyzed malware persistence via registry autorun key
- Detected C2 domains and data exfiltration through Telegram Bot
- Created actionable IOCs and remediation steps

**Technologies & Tools:** Kali Linux, VirusTotal, URLhaus, MxToolBox, CyberChef, MITRE ATT&CK

## üïµÔ∏è Project 3: Carnage - Analyzing malicious network with Wireshark

‚û°Ô∏è **Read it here:** [Carnage - Analyzing malicious network with Wireshark](https://medium.com/@ismaelggm/carnage-0564a12735c7)

**Description:** Walkthrough of a Wireshark analysis for the TryHackMe Carnage room. This repository page summarizes the SOC-style investigation, IOCs, hunting queries, and detection recommendations derived from the pcap analysis.

**What I delivered:**

-Step-by-step Wireshark / SOC investigation notes and screenshots
-Structured IOCs (domains, IPs, filenames, HTTP headers) discovered during the exercise
-Example hunting queries (Wireshark/tshark, Splunk/SIEM, Suricata signature idea)
-Detection guidance and remediation suggestions for SOC engineers

**Key highlights:**

-Reconstructed attacker TTPs and mapped them to MITRE ATT&CK techniques
-Example hunts and KQL/Splunk queries to accelerate analyst response
-Evidence-backed remediation playbook for containment and eradication

**Tools & Tech:** : TryHackMe, Wireshark, Virtual Machine, VirusTotal, , Windows forensic artifacts, CyberChef


## üêæ Project 4: SOC127 ‚Äî SQL Injection Detected (LetsDefend)

‚û°Ô∏è **Read it here:** [SOC127 ‚Äî SQL injection detected (LetsDefend) ‚Äî solution & walkthrough](https://medium.com/@ismaelggm/soc127-sql-injection-detected-letsdefend-solution-d37f7eed52e9)

**Description:** A practical SOC investigation of the ‚ÄúSQL Injection Detected‚Äù alert in LetsDefend. This project provides a full step-by-step analysis of how I handled the alert ‚Äî from triaging the initial detection to confirming exploitation attempts and applying remediation.

**What I delivered:**
- Detailed alert triage workflow and investigation timeline  
- Log and packet analysis to confirm SQLi activity  
- Identification of attacker IPs, payloads, and targeted parameters  
- Final resolution steps and remediation recommendations  

**Key highlights:**
- Hands-on use of LetsDefend‚Äôs SOC platform for alert validation and escalation  
- Correlated IDS alerts with HTTP request logs to confirm SQL injection attempts  
- Demonstrated how to classify and close the alert based on verified evidence  

**Tools & Tech:** LetsDefend SOC platform, Wireshark, ELK Stack, SQLMap, CyberChef, MITRE ATT&CK
