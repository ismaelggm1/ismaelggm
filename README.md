**Key highlights:**
- Extracted sender IP (SPF softfail, DKIM fail)
- Identified malicious URLs and payloads
- Analyzed malware persistence via registry autorun key
- Detected C2 domains and data exfiltration through Telegram Bot
- Created actionable IOCs and remediation steps

**Technologies & Tools:** Kali Linux, VirusTotal, URLhaus, MxToolBox, CyberChef, MITRE ATT&CK
